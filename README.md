# Feexlu
The Repo of Feexlu Project

Feexlu means "Take a breath of fresh air" in Wolof, this idea is the philosophy of our project.
We have the goal to bring small, optimized utilities to the Linux kernel.
It starts from a small program allowing to determine the number of threads created and used 
by a programm, a program to kill a process directly by giving his name to more interessting 
features.
The goal is to avoid painfull trick to obtain certain information about the kernel, the 
application running on the system, the memory usage, the energy usage and more.

The following list, details the programs developed or in progress. We will continue to update
the status of the different programs regularly :+1:

### 1.atm: Application Thread Monitoring

**atm** is a small utility allowing to monitor the differents threads used by a running program.
